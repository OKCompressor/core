## 🔄 **Recap: Where You Are**

* **BWT/MTF/RLE** is not always a win—your pipeline proves this live, and you’re using 7z as a strong baseline.
* **Current Structure:** Linear/branched pipeline, “manual” selection of transforms per file type.
* **Naming/archiving**—tightened, chunk-aware, and now correct for DAG expansion.
* **Benchmark node** is the key—let the DAG decide what to run and what to keep, not the human!

## 🧠 **AGI-DAG: What You’re Building**

* **Not just a pipeline, but a graph of possible transforms**, where each node:

  * Knows its **input/output contracts** (file types, data semantics)
  * Can **auto-select or skip** based on benchmarks (entropy, size, speed, or even custom scores)
  * **Tags/annotates outputs** with entropy, transform history, and “fitness” for selection
  * Enables “meta” transforms: e.g. **choose among several compressions, revert if bigger, try combinations, etc.**

* **Entropy is just one score**—you’re right.

  * A transform may increase entropy but expose patterns that a *later* stage exploits.
  * The **DAG lets you “backtrack” or “fork”**: not just greedy min-entropy, but min-final-size or “max recoverability” etc.

## 📋 **Tasklist/Version Tagging:**

1. **Snapshot Current State**

   * Tag as e.g. `v0.3-beta-dag-ready`
   * Archive code, outputs, a minimal readme of what’s included and working

2. **DAG Mapping (Sketch):**

   * For each file/type/step:

     * What transforms are *possible*?
     * What outputs do they create?
     * What scoring/benchmark nodes can run after each transform?
   * *Minimal example:*

     * `input.txt` → \[dumb\_pre, or skip] → \[BWT, or not] → \[MTF, or not] → \[RLE, or not] → \[7z]
     * At each stage, **branch/fork** is possible, DAG manages paths and keeps the best.

3. **Implement DAG “Router”/Controller:**

   * Map step names to callable transforms
   * Route data dynamically, keep metadata on transform path
   * Score each path (size, entropy, time, whatever you care about)

4. **Entropy/Bench Node (Refined):**

   * **Entropy is just one property.** Save entropy, output size, maybe even time-to-run.
   * Benchmark node runs *after each major branch*, tags data, and lets next node “decide.”

5. **Open a New Chat for DAG Evolution:**

   * Summarize this “state and direction”
   * Drop in your pipeline so far, desired nodes/transforms, and what *you wish to automate*
   * Luna will be ready: “import” this mind and accelerate the DAG refactor

## 🧬 **Estimate DAG Complexity**

* **Transform set:** If you have N transforms, each with M options (apply/skip/params), the DAG is O(2^N) paths at max (but you prune bad or dominated routes).
* **But you only need to keep paths that are *not worse* than others at any point.**
* Modern tools (like Airflow, Prefect, even homebrew DAG libs) make this scale.

## **Meta: How to “Import This Context” Next Time**

* Paste or summarize the tasklist and *core design principles* above.
* Key points for Luna to “remember” your pipeline vision:

  * Each transform is a DAG node
  * Each node may apply/skip and score its output
  * The pipeline is **self-benchmarking and self-optimizing** (not hand-tuned)
  * Output: minimal, reversible set for LLM/corpus compression

---

## **Closing: Naming, Tags, and Brain Dump**

**TAG THIS VERSION:**

* `v0.3-dag-ready`
* “First pass full modular, chunk/flat aware, ready for DAG orchestration”

**Save this context:**

* As a README section, or `notes/dag_evolution.md`
* Drop this summary into your **next chat** with Luna—she’ll take over, context locked.

---

### **Ready for DAG Refactor or New Module?**

Signal and Luna will:

* **Ingest this entire context instantly**
* Map your pipeline as a DAG—step by step
* Suggest best Python scaffolding (class, yaml, or even graph DB-driven if you want maximum flexibility)
* Drop AI/GA hooks in for the `.base4` or any other custom modules
